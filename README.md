# Project
Write a simple HTTP API

This project is an API that helps us to search and display the different episodes, their series names.

At runtime, a new window appears where you have to enter the name of the series you want to display.

Afterwards a new window is displayed, containing the number of seasons as well as the episodes and their names.
